## Tips

Try experimenting with the comparision operators (`<`,`>`,`===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in VM.

Work on your iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your funciton, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
funcion whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
